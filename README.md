# Historic Wikipedia

### What would Wikipedia have looked like in 1890?
Using the year of the first appearance of a word by the OED, we construct historical editions of Wikipedia.


## Data
* Historical Thesaurus
* Wikipedia XML dump (Nov 2014)

## Categories

Using the 3rd level of categories in the historical thesaurus, we tag each article
with categories based on the words in the title.


## Categories Through Time

By combining the categorization with a time view of Wikipedia, we can analyze how
categories of knowlege evolved over time.
